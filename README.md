# About this app

This is a React App that lets the user build his own resume based on a formatted template! 
As the user inputs his personal information, it is displayed live in its formatted version. 
When everything is ready, the user can save a local PDF version of his resume.

# Under the hood

This app was my first app created with React. At first, tt was a perfect mission to familiarize myself with class components and how to use state and props with efficiency.
This last bit proved to be the trickiest part, but it ended up making perfect sense after playing for a while with props and state while building the different functionalities and necessary objects to pass along components.
However, in a further challenge to myself, I refactored the whole app to make its components functional, which is the actual state of the app as of now.

I wanted to implement a way for the user to get his local version of the final resume. I went with the "React-to-print" library to do so. 
While it is working, there is still a problem with the formatting of the output as the content isn't proportionally adjusted when it comes to saving the previewed resume. 
That would then be an obvious adjustement to figure out for further work on this project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
